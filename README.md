## Introdcution
Introducing our work-in-progress application, the first public Dying Light 2 Editor! Developed by a dedicated team of two passionate gamers, our editor empowers you to take control of your Dying Light 2 experience like never before. With this tool, you can manipulate stats and customize items to tailor your in-game adventure to your liking. While not all features are implemented just yet, we're committed to continuously improving and expanding our editor to enhance your gaming journey. Stay tuned for updates and join us in shaping your Dying Light 2 experience!
## Structure
Our current project comprises two distinct yet interconnected applications working in synergy. The first application, built in Python, serves as a platform for testing purposes. It fulfills a range of vital functions, from comprehensive testing to parsing and even experimentation with the manipulation of save files. Its versatile capabilities lay the groundwork for the project's core functionality.

Complementing the Python application our second application is being developed using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and C#. This application is the face of our project, focusing entirely on the user interface and ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience. It acts as the interface through which the results and outcomes of the Python application are implemented and presented to users.

For further information regarding the application, please check out the following [README](./c_sharp/DL2_Editor/README.md).
